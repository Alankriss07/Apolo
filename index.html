    <p>
        I know you’ve been feeling worried about your job, about us, and about the future, and I’m truly sorry for the times I’ve hurt you. 
        Please believe me when I say that it was never intentional. You mean everything to me. 
        If sometimes I seem slow to understand your feelings or miss the little things, it’s not because I don’t care — it’s something I’m working on, 
        and I promise I’ll become more attentive and emotionally present for you.
    </p>

    <p>
        No matter what happens, I will always stand by your side — supporting you, growing with you, and doing everything I can to give you the beautiful, secure, 
        and happy life you deserve. I don’t just dream about our future, I’m ready to work for it with you, step by step. 
        Every picture of us reminds me how lucky I am and how many more memories I want to create with you.
    </p>

    <h2>I love you, always. ❤️</h2>

    <h2>Our Goals — Together 💫</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>When we’re back in Bangalore, we’ll work on making a strong switch within the next 2–3 months to an MNC with a package of 20+ LPA.</li>
        <li>Open a bank account for address verification and then apply for the passport using that address.</li>
        <li>Rent a flat in Bangalore and live together, understanding and growing with each other.</li>
        <li>By the end of the year, plan at least one international trip on our own — Bali, Vietnam, Canada, or wherever we decide.</li>
        <li>Focus seriously on our health — choosing what’s good for our bodies over temporary cravings and building a healthy lifestyle together.</li>
        <li>Create a beautiful, peaceful, posh home in Bangalore — our own little fairyland, designed and filled with love.</li>
    </ul>
